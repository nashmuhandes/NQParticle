NQParticle
----------

Written by Nash Muhandes

An attempt to replicate the unique scaling properties of Quake's
particles.

In Quake, the size of the particles scale up with distance. The farther a
particle is, the larger in size they'd become.

I did not refer to Quake's source code - this was a completely off-the-cuff
approximation, based entirely on observation.

Obviously not accurate to Quake, and I didn't set it out be.
